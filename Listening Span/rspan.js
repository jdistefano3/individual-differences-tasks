////////////////////////////
// AUTOMATED READING SPAN //
////////////////////////////

/*
Overview:
This is a jsPsych implementation of the popular
automated reading span task, which is one of
several 'complex span' assessments of working
memory. Participants read sentences and determine
whether or not they make sense. This sentence
task is interleaved with a letter memory task,
in which a single letter is presented on the
screen. Participants go through this interleaved
sentence/letter process anywhere from 3-7 times
on a trial.
Then, participants must recall the letter string
IN ORDER to the best of their ability. Participants
are also encouraged to keep their sentence accuracy
above 85%, keeping in line with prior research.
To Use:
1. Load this js file in your html file.
2. Reference the css (rspanstyle.css) in your html file
3. Push the variable 'rspan_final' to your timeline in your html file

//TIMELINE VARIABLES//

/*
NOTE: Due to the particular nature of the complex span (interleaving
sentence and letter within and across trials), the 'main_sentences'
timline variable is not treated as a traditional timeline variable.
Rather, the array is randomized and then for each sentence an index
selects one element (sequentially). Because the array was randomized,
this ensures that the main sentences are presented in random order
AND that each sentence is only presented one time in the experiment.
There is probably a more elegant way of doing this, but oh well.
